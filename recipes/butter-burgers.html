    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I'd heard about Wisconsin's butter burgers, had one at a well-known restaurant chain, and finally made my own. You can choose your toppings, but in Wisconsin, grilled onions are often included. That butter on the bun adds a rich flavor and takes this burger over the top 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>4 (2 ounce) hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly spread 2 tablespoons butter on all cut sides of the buns and quickly toast them on a griddle, large skillet, or under the broiler, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside</li>
        <li>Shape ground beef into 4 burgers, a little larger than the size of the bun, as they'll shrink slightly when cooked. Season with salt and peppe</li>
        <li>Place burgers on the griddle or into a large skillet, and cook over medium heat to your preferred doneness, 7 to 10 minutes, flipping once. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Place a slice of cheese on each burger, and cook until cheese starts to melt, about 1 more minute.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, liberally spread about 1 tablespoon of butter on the top half of each toasted bun. Place the burger with cheese on the bottom bun, and add your favorite toppings. Place the buttered top half on the burger, and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
